Game of Thrones Character Tracker

Simple app for searching for Game of Thrones characters and their relevant personal details.

Usage

To get started, simply choose between the "Search by Name" or "Search by Traits" buttons.
Searching by name will display a text input to search for your characters name and searching through traits will enable you to select from a list of characters that meet your culture selection and status criteria. Clicking on a character in this list will display all of their available data. Characters without recorded names are filtered out of the final result.
